## Hello World

This is my first blog post. I just set this blog up with [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) and GitHub's pages. It's pretty cool, github pages auto builds the jekyll so you don't have to commit the generated pages to git. Which is pretty cool.

Testing some code formatting for c++, since I'll be using that mostly:
{% highlight cpp %}
int main() {
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight cpp %}

That looks pretty cool. As for what to expect from this blog, I'll be talking mostly about my game dev stuff, maybe some general programming stuff and perhaps even just generic tech industry stuff. 

I think that's enough for this first post. Let's see if this one sticks, eh?
