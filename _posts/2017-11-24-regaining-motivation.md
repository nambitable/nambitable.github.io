I keep forgetting to update this. But I think this stems from a deeper problem around motivation and accountability on personal projects. There's so many different things I wish to accomplish but then I get home from work and I feel a lack of motivation on working towards any of them. So instead I opt to play some video games, watch TV and subsequently go to sleep. There's nothing wrong with either of those things but the lack of any recently completed side projects hits particularly hard during moments of introspection. 

There are a multitude of things I wish to accomplish ranging from studying more category theory to creating some websites and apps, writing stories and all the way to finishing up a game project. When I started to write this entry, I decided to list down all the things I wished to accomplish. And then break them down into milestones with deliverables. Sort of like how we do project deliveries at work. But for a single person team, that's probably not the right approach. So instead, I'm going to start (and complete) one thing I've been meaning to get to...a todo app. 

## Todo app

There's a bunch of such apps and websites and I have tried a lot of them. Wunderlist, Todoist, even taskwarrior (which comes eerily close) are all so close to what I want but just not exactly right. So in all my productive bouts of free time from this point onwards, I am going to work on this todo app. I'll use react and [react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) to build a website and android app with the following requirements:

* Simple todo addition. Type and hit enter to add a new note.
* Kanban like columns, represent the "state" of a todo.
* Swipe on phone / drag and drop on webpage to move todo between different states.
* If there's only in progress/done states, simply clicking on a checkbox should be enough.
* API exposed from server side. React/React native will only be used client side.
* I'll use scala to build the server side / backend as I do hate JS coding and it'll help with my scala skills.

Future posts on this blog should be about the Todo app. What I lack is a singleminded focus on one particular project. Future prospects for the app will include adding users/accounts to the app in order to let others use it. But as long as my personal use case is accomplished, I will consider V1 of the project to be complete. 

I'll break this down into simple milestones:
* M1: Server side complete
* M2: Web page complete
* M3: Android app complete

Let's see how this one pans out. 

>Onward, and upward, and true to the line.
